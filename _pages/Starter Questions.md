1. The mass of a helium-4 nucleus is 4.0015u. Calculate the binding energy per nucleon.  
	1. $5.26\times 10^{-29}kg$
	2. $e=mc^{2}$
	3. $5.26\times 10^{-29}(3\times 10^{8})^{2}$
	4. $=4.734\times 10^{-12}J$
	5. $e=\frac{4.734\times 10^{-12}}{1.6\times 10^{-19}}$
	6. $28592450EV$
	7. $29.952MeV$
	8. $\frac{29.952}{7}$
	9. $7.3975MeV \ \text{per nucleon}$

2. A curcuit consists of two resistors $R_1=6\Omega$ and $R_{2}=12\Omega$, connected in parallel. This parallel combination is then connected in series with a third resistor, $R_{3}=10 \Omega$, and a battery providing a voltage of 24V. 
	1. What is the total resistance of the circuit?
		1. 
	2. Calculate the total current supplied by the battery.
	3. Determine the voltage drop across each resistor. 
	4. Find the current through each resistor. 

3. How much energy does it take 700g of ice at $-7\degree C$ to evaporate to steam at $110\degree C$?













1. Describe how the Kinetic Particle Model explains the differences in particle arrangement and motion in solids, liquids, and gases. How do these differences relate to the properties of each state of matter?
	1. Solids: Have a tight lattice structure, not allowing much movement between each. 
	2. Liquids: Have a relaxed structure allowing movement between each atom
	3. Gases: Don't have a structure, allowing free movement. 
2. Using the Kinetic Particle Model, explain how changes in temperature affect the energy and movement of particles in a substance. How do these changes influence the pressure exerted by a gas in a closed container?
	1. As a substance is heated, the atoms gain more energy, meaning that they move more. 
		1. If a gas is heated in a closed container, the pressure exerted outward by the gas would cause the pressure inside the container to increase.
