1 Calorie = The amount of energy needed to heat 1g of water to 1 degrees Celsius. 
1 Calorie = 4.186J.

# Specific Heat Capacity
If heat flows (Q) into an object, its temperature will rise assuming it is not undergoing a phase change. 
The amount of heat required to change the temperature of a substance is proportional to the mass of the substance. 
The specific heat capacity of a substance is the measure of the amount of energy required to raise the temperature of that substance by 1 degree Celsius. 
## Formula
$Q=mc \Delta T$
*Where*
Q = the amount of heat added to or removed (J).
m = the mass of the substance (kg).
$\Delta T$ = change in temperature (C or K).
c = the specific heat capacity of the substance ($Jkg^{-1} K^{-1}$)



# Starter Question
**A 200g block of copper at 150 $\degree$C is dropped into 500g of water at 25 $\degree$C. What is the final temperature? Assume no heat is lost to the surroundings.** 
- Copper = 390J/Kg/K
$Q=mc\Delta T$ 
$M_{c}C_{c}(T_{if}-T_{f})=M_{w}C_w(T_{f}-T_{iw})$
$200\times 390 \times (150-T_{f})=500 \times 4120 \times (T_{f}-T_{25})$
$11700-t_{f}=2090T_{f}-52250$
	$63950=2168T_{f}$
	$T_{f}=\frac{63950}{2168}$
	$T_{f}=29$
