$$E=mc^2$$
E = energy
m = mass
c = $3\times10^8ms^{-1}$ 
# New Unit of Energy - the Electron volt, eV
- Increase the electrical potential of an electron by one volt. 
One electron volt, 1eV = $1.60\times10^{-19}$ Joules. 

# Binding Energy

> [!def]
> The binding energy of a nucleus is defined as the work that must be done on the nucleus to separate it and its constituents, (ie neutrons and protons). 

If we remove all the nucleons from a nucleus we find that the total mass of the separated nucleons is greater than the combined mass of the nucleons joined together as a nucleus. This difference between the mass of the separated nucleons and the combined mass of the nucleus is called the **Mass Defect**.
$$M_{separated} > M_{combined}+E_b \leftarrow E=mc^2$$
Alpha particles consist of two protons and two neutrons bound together into a particle identical to a helium-4 nucleus: $^4_2He$.
Mass Defect = the difference between the separated particles vs the combined particles. 
Mass Defect = the total binding energy of the nucleus. 


## Questions
1. The mass of a neon-20 atom is 3.318745$\times10^{-26}$kg. Calculate its mass defect in both atomic mass units and kilograms. 
Proton = $1.67262192 Ã— 10^{-27}$ kilograms
Neutron = $1.674 \times 10^{-27}$ kg.


# Starter Question
$^4_2H$ is the most abundant isotope of helium. It's mass is 5.5546$\times10^{-27}$. What is:
a. The mass defect?
	$Mass Defect=4\times(Whatever \ The \ Mass \ of \ the \ Protons \ and \ Neutrons \ are)-5.5546\times10^{-27}$
b. The binding energy of the nucleus in joules?
	$e=mass Defect\times(3\times10^8ms^{-1})^2$
c. The binding energy of the nucleus in electron volts?
	Answer above, $/1.60\times10^{-19}$
