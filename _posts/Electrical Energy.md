# Electric Charge
- Electric charge is a fundamental property of many subatomic particles. 
- Electric charge can be either positive or negative. 
- Objects can become charged by losing electrons (results in a positive charge) or gaining electrons (results in a negative charge). 

- Nucleus consist of protons and electrons. 
- Electrons are orbiting the nucleus. 
## Ion

> [!def]
> - *When an atom has lost of gained electrons, the atom has become an ion.* 

- *The movement of charged particles (electrons & ions) from one area to another through a medium is commonly known as electricity.* 

# Measuring Electric Charge
- To measure the actual amount of an object, a 'natural' unit would be the magnitude of the charge on 1 electron. 
- This fundamental constant of charge is known as the **Elementary Charge**, *e*. 
- The SI unit of *charge* is the **coulomb** (*C*). 
- 1 Coulomb of charge is equivalent to the charge on $6.25\times 10^{18}$ protons or electrons. 
- Therefore the charge of 1 electron = $-1.6\times 10^{-19}$ C. 

### Example
Calculate the charge, in coulombs, carried by 6.0 billion electrons. 
$1 \ billion = 10^9$
$1e=-1.6 \times 10^{-19}$ C
$\therefore \ 6 \ billion \ electrons = 6\times 10^9 \times -1.6\times 10^{-19}$ C
	$=-9.6\times 10^{-10}$ C

The net charge  on an object is -3$\upmu$C. Calculate the number of extra electrons on the object. 
$-3\upmu C=3\times10^{-6}$ 
$1e=-1.6\times1-^{-19}C$
	$\therefore -3\times10^{-6}C=\frac{-3\times10^{-6}}{-1.6\times10^{-19}}$
   
# Electrical Conductors and Insulators
- Electrons move more freely in some materials than others. 
- In metals, the electrons are only slightly attracted to their respective nuclei. Hence metals are good electrical conductors. 
- In comparison the electrons in non-metals are more tightly bound to their respective nuclei & cannot readily move through the material. These are insulators. 

# Current
(I)
Unit: Amperes (A)

- *A current is a flow of charge within a conductor.* This flow of charge or current is restrained by the electrical **resistance** of the circuit. 
- Charge flows when there is a *potential difference* or difference in voltage across the ends of a conductor. 

- An ampere is teh flow of 1 Coulomb of charge per second:
	- $(1A=1Cs^{-1})$ at any given point on the wire)
		- or
	- $1A=6.25\times10^{18}$ electrons per second. 
- Most circuits carry currents of mA or $\upmu$A. 
- $$Current = \frac{Charge}{Time} \ ie \ I=\frac{Q}{T}$$ 

	Q = Charge (Coulomb)
	t = Time (Seconds)

# Conventional Current
- Conventional current flows from positive to negative. 
- Conventional current is a historical convention which does not represent the actual movement of particles in a metallic conductor. 
- *In metals, electrons move from negative to positive.* 
- **All our calculations are performed using conventional current.**

# Electrical Potential Difference
- The electrical potential difference between two points in a conductor carrying a current is defined as: 
	- *the work done per unit charge in moving a positive charge from a point of higher potential to a point of lower potential*
	- $$\Delta V=\frac{\Delta W}{q}=\frac{\Delta E_p}{q}$$
		- V = Voltage
		- W = Work
		- q = Charge
		- $E_p$ = Potential Energy
- *Two charges have the same electric potential. The 2Q charge has more potential energy.* 

## Example
A 12.0V motorcycle battery that can move 500C of charge, and a 12V car battery can move 60,000C of charge. 
How much energy does each deliver? (Assume that the numerical value of each charge is accurate to three significant figures.)
$\Delta V=\frac{\Delta E_p}{q}$
$12=\frac{E_p}{5000}$ 
	$=5000\times12=6\times10^4J$

# Electric Potential Difference & Current
- Work must be done on a positive test charge to move it through the cells from the negative terminal to the positive terminal. 
- This work would increase the potential energy of the charge and this increase its electric potential. 
- As the positive test charge moves through the *external circuit* from the positive terminal to the negative terminal, it decreases its electric potential energy and thus is at low potential by the time it returns to the negative terminal. 
- The loss of this electric potential energy in the external circuit results in a gain in light energy, thermal energy and other forms of non-electrical energy. 
- If a 12 volt batter is used in the circuit, then every coulomb of charge is gaining 12 joules of potential energy as it moves through the battery. 
# Energy and Power
Power delivery within an electrical circuit can also be deduced from voltage and current values:
$$Recall \ \Delta V=\frac{\Delta W}{q} \ and \ I=\frac{Q}{t}$$
$P=\frac{W}{t}$
$P=\frac{Vq}{t}=V\frac{q}{t}$ 
$P=VI$ 
*Power unit: Watts, W*

$P=\frac{W}{t}$
$W=Pt$
$W=VIt$

P = Power
W = Work, Potential Energy
t = Time
V = Voltage
I = Current

## Example
A 12V lamp used a current of 3A. What is the power of the lamp?
$P=VI$
$P=12\times3$
$P=36 \ Watts$

An electric radiator uses a voltage of 240V and draws a current of 2A for a total time of 3hours. Calculate the total energy dissipated by the radiator.
Note: Energy = Work done
$W=VIt$
$W=240\times2\times(3\times60\times60)$
$W=5184000 \ Joules$
$W=5.2\times10^6J \ (2sf)$

# AC & DC
AC - Alternating Current
	Creates a wave of voltage, power supply in a wall. 
DC - Direct Current
	Steady voltage, from a battery or regulated power supply, ideal for electronic circuits. 


# Ohm's Law
## Resistance
	Changes:
	- Voltage
	- Current Flow

- When a potential difference is applied across a wire, the electrons tend to more from the negative terminal towards the positive terminal. 
- This movement is not a straight line, rather the electrons zig zag as they collide with the atoms in the wire, *the wire resists the flow of charge.* 
- *Anything that impedes the flow of current is a resistor. This deterrent to the flow of charge is termed **resistance***. 
- The amount of current flowing in a conductor is determined by the voltage of the circuits electrical resistance. 

## Ohm's Law

> [!def]
> Ohm's law describes the relationship between resistance, current and voltage. The resistance R, of a circuit component is defined as the ratio of the potential difference (V) to the current (I). 

$$V=IR$$
$Voltage=Current\times Resistance$
$Volts(V)$
$Amps(A)$
$Ohms(\Omega)$ 

### Example
A frying pan is connected to a 110-volt circuit. If the resistance of the frying pan is 10 ohms, how many amperes does the frying pan draw?
- $I=\frac{V}{R}$
- $I=\frac{110}{10}$
- $I=11A$

Find the resistance of the light if $I=2mA$ and $V=6V$. 
- $V=IR$
- $R=\frac{V}{I}$
- $R=\frac{6}{2\div1000}$ 
- $R=3000 \ Ohms$  ($\Omega$)

### Graphical Representation
For Ohmic conductors if we plot a graph of Voltage (V) vs Current (I) we get a linear graph of gradient (R).
$y=mx+c$
$V=IR$
$V=RI$
$y=RI+0$
$m=R$

### Non-Ohmic Conductors
If a non-ohmic device, the resistance is not constant, and the graph is non-linear. Current does not vary proportionally with the voltage across the device. 
*Examples: Light globes, diodes, LED's, thermistors, LDR's.* 
**Gradient is not constant.**
