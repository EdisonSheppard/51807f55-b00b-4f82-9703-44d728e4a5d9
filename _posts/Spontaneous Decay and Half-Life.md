# Radioactive Decay
- Random process. 
- Not possible to predict if one particular atom will undergo spontaneous radioactive decay. 
- Possible to predict the behaviour of a large number of atoms. 
- Amount of radioactivity present is defined as the number of spontaneous decays occurring per second. 
- Rate of decay is directly proportional to the size of the sample. 

# Half Life
The time it takes the number of atoms of an isotope to fall to half of their original value at time t=0, is the half life of the isotope (T$_{\frac{1}{2}}$). 
After T$_{\frac{1}{2}}$ the number of radioactive atoms reduces from N$_{\frac{1}{2}}$
Radium($^{226}$Ra)T$_{\frac{1}{2}}$ = 1620 years
At t=0 say we have 100g
When t = T$_{\frac{1}{2}}$ (ie 1620 years) we will have 50g left. 50g will have decayed. 
When t=2T$_{\frac{1}{2}}$ (ie 3240 years) we will have 25g left. 75g will have decayed. 
When t=3T$_{\frac{1}{2}}$(ie 4860 years) we will have 12.5g left. 87.5g will have decayed. 
## Key Formula
$$N=N_{0}(\frac{1}{2})^n$$
N = number of nuclei remaining. 
$N_0$ = number present originally. 
n = number of half lives. 

### Example
Halflife of Zn-71 is 2.4 minutes. 
If one had 100.0g at the beginning, how many grams would e left after 7.2 minutes has elapsed. 
$$n=\frac{total time}{T_{\frac{1}{2}}}$$
$$n=\frac{7.2}{2.4}=3$$
$$N=100\times\frac{1}{2}^3=12.5$$
## Examples
9. The half-life of 1-131 is 8.07 days. If 25 g are left after 40.35 days, how many grams were in the original sample?
   $n=\frac{40.35}{8.07}$
   $n=5$
   $25=N_{0}\frac{1}{2}^5$
   $25=N_{0}\times0.03125$
   $N_{0}=\frac{25}{0.03125}$
   $N_0=800g$

# Spontaneous Decay and Nuclear Equations
## Radioactivity
- Occurs when an unstable atom emits part of itself.
- May change into another element - Artificial Transmutation
- Becomes *more* stable. 

## Alpha Particles $\alpha$
- occurs when the nucleus has **too many protons**. 
- kicks out helium nuclei, consisting 2 protons and 2 neutrons (no electrons), $^{4}_{2}H^{2+}$. 
- emitted with up to 20% speed of light. 
- highest ionising ability. 
- low penetrating power. 
- range in air of a few centimetres. 
- absorbed by a piece of paper. 
## Beta Negative & Positive $\beta$
- $\beta ^{-}$ are electrons, $^0_{-1}e^{1-}$ 
- $\beta ^{+}$ are positrons, $^{0}_{1}e^{1+}$ 
- emitted at close to the speed of light. 
- more penetrating ability than alpha, less than gamma. 
- less ionising than alpha, more ionising than gamma.
- travel up to 1m in air. 
- absorbed by 5mm of aluminium. 

- converts to the opposite sign in the nucleus, emits a positron (negative) or a electron (positive), and emits anti matter. 
### Beta decay
#### Beta Negative decay
- a neutron decays into a proton, an electron, and an antineutrino. 
	- $^1_{0}n\rightarrow ^1_1p+^0_{-1}e+^0_0v$ 
#### Beta Positive Decay
- A proton decays into a neutron, a positron, and a neutrino. 
	- $^1_{1}p\rightarrow^1_0n$

## Gamma Radiation $\gamma$
- electromagnetic radiation, $^0_0\gamma$ 
- occurs when a nucleus decays from an excited state ie it has to much energy; usually following an $\alpha$ or $\beta$ decay. 
- massless photons emitted, no physical matter. 
- travels at the speed of light. 
- has the lowest ionising ability. 
- highest penetrating power. 
- passes through many kinds of material, including human tissue. 
- very dense materials, such as lead, are commonly used as shielding to slow or stop gamma rays. 

## Decay Equations
- to show what happens before and after a nuclear reaction, we use equations to show both the proton (Z) and nucleon number (A). 
- to balance a nuclear equation you have to make sure that the sum of the nucleon (top) numbers on the left hand side equals the sum of the nucleon numbers on the right hand side AND the sum of the proton numbers on both sides also balance.

| Beta Negative    | $^{14}_6C\rightarrow ^{14}_7N+^0_{-1}e+v$                | $^A_ZX \rightarrow ^1_{Z+1}Y+^0_{-1}+v$      |
| Beta positive    | $^{232}_{90}Th \rightarrow ^{232}_{89}Ac + ^0_{+1}e_-+v$ | $^A_ZX \rightarrow ^A_{Z-1}Y + ^0_{+1}e^-+v$ |
| Gamma            |                                                          | $^A_ZX \rightarrow ^A_ZX+\gamma$             |
## Unstable to Stable Nuclides
- A radionuclide will, through a series of spontaneous decays, become stable. Goes through different elements. 

## Example
Thorium-232 decays by emitting an alpha particle. Write a nuclear equation for this. 
$^{232}_{90}Th \rightarrow ^{228}_{88}Ra+^4_2He$ 


Carbon - 14 decays by emitting a beta positive particle. Write a equation. 
$^{14}_bC \rightarrow +^0_1e^-+\nu$
