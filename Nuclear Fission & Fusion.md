## Starter Question

$q=mc\Delta T$ 
$q=0.3\times c_{ice} \times 10 + l_f\times0.3$ 

# Nuclear Fission

> [!def]
> - The process in which a heavy nucleus is split into lighter nuclei. 

- Eg. Uranium-235 absorbs a neutron, it turns into uranium-236, which can decay into krypton and barium 0, and will release another 3 neutrons. 
- In a nuclear fission reaction, mass is converted directly into energy through Einstein's formula, $e=mc^2$. 
# Nuclear Reactors
A nuclear reactor is a machine in which nuclear reactions take place, priducting energy. 
When uranium-235 captures a neutron, two possible processes are:
$^1_0n + ^{235}_{92}U\rightarrow ^{236}_{92}U\rightarrow ^{140}_{54}Xe + ^{94}_{38}Sr + 2^1_0n$ 

$^1_0n + ^{235}_{92}U\rightarrow ^{236}_{92}U\rightarrow ^{92}_{36}Kr + ^{141}_{56}Ba + 3^1_0n$  

# Energy Released - Example
How much energy is produced by neutron induced nuclear fission of U-235 when it produces Te-137 and Zr-97? 
Nuclides masses are:
- U-235 = 235.04392 u
- Te-137=136.92532 u
- Zr-97 = 96.91095 u

$^1_0n + ^{235}_{92}U\rightarrow ^{236}_{92}U\rightarrow ^{137}_{52}Te+^{97}_{40}Zr... +2^1_0n$ 

**Lefthand Side**
$m_n+m_{U-235}=1.6749275\times10^{-27}$
	$+(235.04392\times1.66\times10^{-27}$ 
$m_{LHS}=3.918478347\times10^{-25}kg$

**Righthand Side**
$2m_n+m_{Te-137}+m_{Zr-97}=2\times1.6749275\times10^{-27}$
	$+(136.92532\times1.66\times10^{-27})+(96\div91095\times1.66\times10^{-27})$
$M_{RHS}=3/915180632\times10^{-25}kg$ 

$\Delta m = m_{LHS}-m_{RHS}=3.91878347\times 10 ^{-25}-3.915180632\times 10^{-25}$
	$=3.297715\times10^{-28}kg$


$e=mc^2$
$e=3.297715\times10^{-28}\times(3\times10^8)^2=2.9679435\times10^{-11}J$ 

These are examples of **induced fission**. 
The neutrons produced can then be used to collide with other uranium-235 nuclei in the reactor, producing more fission, more energy and more neutrons. 
The reaction is self-sustaining and called a **chain reaction**. 
The the chain reaction to get going a certain minimum mass of uranium-235 must be present, otherwise neutrons would escape without causing further reactions. This minimum mass is called the **critical mass**. 

# Nuclear Energy
## Advantages
- High power output
- Large reserves of nuclear fuels
- Nuclear power stations do not produce greenhouse gases

## Disadvantages
- Radioactive waste produces difficult to dispose of
- Major public health hazard should 'something go wrong'
- Problems associated with uranium mining
- Possibility of producing materials for nuclear weapons


In a fast breeder reactor, a fast neutron, mass of 1.01u, causes fission of Pu-238(239.05u). One of the two fission fragments is Tc-104(103.91u); three neutrons are also released. The mass defect in this event is 0.19u. 
a. What is the nuclide symbol for the second fission fragment?
b. Write the nuclear fission reaction using correct nuclide and nucleon symbols. 
c. Determine the mass defect for the reaction, giving the answer in kilograms. 
d. How much energy is released? Give your answer in joules. 


# Nuclear Fusion

> [!def]
> - The process of **light atoms uniting to form heavier atoms**. This **releases energy**. 

## Why is Fusion Considered a More Efficient Energy Source To Fission?

- Great challenges associated with fusion, very large possible benefits. 
- Emits less pollutants than coal, and is more efficient. 

## Typical Reaction
$$^2_{1}H+^3_{1}H\rightarrow^4_{2}He+^1_{0}n+17.6MeV$$ 
- Deuterium (D) can be extracted from water. 
- More mass is being converted to energy in fusion compared to fission. More energy released per nucleon in comparison to fission.
